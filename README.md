Bipolar disorder, psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people (QS102)

Quality statement 1: Assessment for a first
episode of psychosis
Quality statement
Children and young people who are referred to a specialist mental health service with a
first episode of psychosis start assessment within 2 weeks.

Rationale
Starting assessment for a first episode of psychosis within 2 weeks can improve outcomes
by reducing the duration of untreated psychosis, as longer periods of untreated psychosis
are linked to worse outcomes. Specialist mental health services can improve symptoms
and clinical outcomes such as admission and relapse rates.

Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

Structure
Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that systems are in place for children and young
people who are referred to a specialist mental health service with a first episode of
psychosis to start assessment within 2 weeks.
Data source: Local data collection.

Process
Proportion of children and young people who are referred to a specialist mental health
service with a first episode of psychosis who start assessment within 2 weeks.

referral.
Denominator – the number of children and young people who are referred to a specialist
mental health service with a first episode of psychosis.
Data source: Local data collection. National data are collected in the NHS Digital Child and
Adolescent Mental Health Services secondary uses data set with Mental Health Services
Data Set (MHSDS).

Outcome
a) Mental health admission rates for children and young people.
Data source: Local data collection. National data are collected in the NHS Digital Child and
Adolescent Mental Health Services secondary uses data set with Mental Health Services
Data Set (MHSDS).
b) Duration of untreated psychosis.
Data source: Local data collection.

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as child and adolescent mental health services and early
intervention in psychosis services) ensure that systems and protocols are in place for
children and young people who are referred to a specialist mental health service with a
first episode of psychosis to start assessment within 2 weeks.
Healthcare professionals (such as psychologists and psychiatrists) start assessment of
children and young people who are referred with a first episode of psychosis within
2 weeks of referral.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) commission
specialist mental health services that start assessment within 2 weeks for children and
young people who are referred with a first episode of psychosis.

Bipolar disorder, psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people (QS102)

Children and young people who have been havinghallucinations or delusions(believing
things that aren't true) for 4 weeks or more for the first time start an assessment within
2 weeks of being referred to a specialist mental health service (such as a child and
adolescent mental health service or an early intervention in psychosis service). These
services find out why the child or young person is having hallucinations or delusions, and
will provide support and treatment to prevent them from coming back. This will reduce the
chance that the child or young person needs to be admitted to hospital.

Definitions of terms used in this quality statement
A first episode of psychosis
A first presentation of sustained psychotic symptoms (lasting 4 weeks or more).
Symptoms may include 'positive symptoms' such as hallucinations (perception in the
absence of any stimulus) and 'negative symptoms' such as emotional apathy, lack of drive,
poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. [NICE's guideline on psychosis and
schizophrenia in children and young people, recommendation 1.3.1 (key priority for
implementation) and Introduction]

Quality statement 2: Family intervention
Quality statement
Children and young people with a first episode of psychosis and their family members are
offered family intervention.

Rationale
Families play an important part in providing care and support to children and young people
with a first episode of psychosis. When family intervention forms part of a broad-based
approach that combines different treatment options tailored to the needs of the individual
and their family, it can improve coping skills and relapse rates for children and young
people with a first episode of psychosis.

Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

Structure

What the quality statement means for different
audiences
Service providers (such as child and adolescent mental health services and early
intervention in psychosis services) ensure that family intervention is an available treatment
option for children and young people with a first episode of psychosis and their family
members. They should ensure that practitioners are trained and have the appropriate
competencies to deliver it.

young people with a first episode of psychosis and their family members to be referred for
family intervention.
Children and young people with a first episode of psychosis and their family members
are offered a psychological therapy called family intervention. This helps support families
or carers to work together to help children and young people with psychosis cope and to
reduce stress.

child or young person with a first episode of psychosis lives with or is in close contact
with. [NICE's guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people]

A first episode of psychosis
A first presentation of sustained psychotic symptoms (lasting 4 weeks or more).
Symptoms may include 'positive symptoms' such as hallucinations (perception in the
absence of any stimulus) and 'negative symptoms' such as emotional apathy, lack of drive,
poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. [NICE's guideline on psychosis and
schizophrenia in children and young people, recommendation 1.3.1 (key priority for
implementation) and Introduction]

• take account of the whole family's preference for either single-family intervention or
multi-family group intervention
• take account of the relationship between the parents or carers and the child or young
person with psychosis
• have a specific supportive, educational or treatment function and include negotiated
problem solving or crisis management work.
[NICE's guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people,
recommendation 1.3.27]

The delivery and duration of family intervention should be adjusted if necessary to take
account of any learning disabilities, autism or cognitive impairment in the child or young
person with psychosis or their family members, and healthcare professionals should
consider consulting a relevant specialist.
The workforce across agencies should, as far as possible, reflect the local community.
Practitioners should have training to ensure that they have a good understanding of the
culture of families they are working with. Interpreters should be provided if no practitioner
is available who speaks a language in which the family members can communicate easily.

Quality statement 3: Psychological
intervention
Quality statement
Children and young people newly diagnosed with bipolar depression or a first episode of
psychosis are offered a psychological intervention.

Rationale
Psychological interventions (in conjunction with antipsychotic medication, or on their own
if medication is declined or not needed) can improve outcomes for bipolar depression and
psychosis. The psychological intervention will be based on a psychological assessment
and formulation, and will aim to reduce distress, promote social and educational recovery,
reduce social anxiety and depression, and prevent relapse in children and young people.

audiences
Service providers (such as child and adolescent mental health services and early
intervention in psychosis services) ensure that a psychological intervention is available as
a treatment option for children and young people newly diagnosed with bipolar depression
or a first episode of psychosis. They should ensure that practitioners are trained and have
the appropriate competencies to deliver psychological interventions.

bipolar depression or a first episode of psychosis.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) commission
services that offer a psychological intervention to children and young people newly
diagnosed with bipolar depression or a first episode of psychosis.
Children and young people who are diagnosed with bipolar depressionor a first episode
of psychosis are offered a psychological therapy. This involves meeting a healthcare
professional on their own or with a parent or carer to talk about their feelings and
thoughts, which can help them to find ways to cope with their symptoms. For children and
young people with psychosis, psychological therapy works better when they also take
antipsychotic medication (medicine to help with psychosis).

The delivery and duration of a psychological intervention should be adjusted if necessary
to take account of any learning disabilities, autism or cognitive impairment a child or young
person with bipolar depression or psychosis has, and healthcare professionals should
consider consulting a relevant specialist.
Specialist mental health services should provide children and young people from diverse
ethnic and cultural backgrounds with culturally appropriate psychological and
psychosocial treatment, and address cultural and ethnic differences in beliefs about
biological, social and family influences on mental states.

Quality statement 4: Support for carers
Quality statement
Parents and carers of children and young people newly diagnosed with bipolar disorder,
psychosis or schizophrenia are given information about carer-focused education and
support.

Rationale
Carer-focused education and support enhances engagement and reduces carer burden
and psychological distress, and may improve the carer's quality of life. As part of the initial
process of assessment and engagement, carer-focused education and support can also
help carers of children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia
to be able to identify and monitor symptoms of concern.

Quality statement 5: Healthy lifestyle
advice
Quality statement
Children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia are given
healthy lifestyle advice at diagnosis and at annual review.

Rationale
As they get older, children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or
schizophrenia have poorer physical health than the general population and a reduced life
expectancy. Health problems may sometimes be linked to lifestyle factors and risky
behaviours, and are exacerbated by the use of antipsychotic drugs. It is important that
primary care and specialist mental health services take a proactive approach to promoting
positive health behaviours from a young age by giving age-appropriate healthy lifestyle
advice at diagnosis and at annual review.

Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

Structure
a) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that children and young people with bipolar
disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia are given healthy lifestyle advice at diagnosis.
Data source: Local data collection.
b) Evidence of local arrangements to ensure that children and young people with bipolar
disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia being supported in primary care or specialist mental
health services are given healthy lifestyle advice at their annual review.

Quality statement 6: Monitoring for side
effects of antipsychotic medication
Quality statement
Children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia prescribed
antipsychotic medication have their treatment monitored for side effects.

Rationale
Children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia are
particularly vulnerable to the adverse side effects of antipsychotic medication, including
rapid weight gain and metabolic disturbances. This, combined with higher rates of
smoking, leads to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders than the
general population. Regular monitoring will allow antipsychotic medication to be adjusted
so that side effects are minimised, and so that physical health interventions can be offered
if needed.

Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

Structure

disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia, and share the results when the child or young person
is in the care of primary and secondary care services.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) commission
services that monitor the side effects of antipsychotic medication for children and young
people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia. They should also ensure that
arrangements are in place to share the results of monitoring when the child or young
person is in the care of primary and secondary services.
Children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia who are
taking antipsychotic medication (medicine to help with psychosis) should see their
healthcare professional regularly to check for side effects. This will include regular checks
such as blood tests and measurements of their weight, height, waist, hip, pulse and blood
pressure, to check for problems that may be caused by their medication (such as weight
gain, diabetes, and heart, lung and breathing problems). The results of all health checks
should be discussed with the child or young person and their parents or carers and shared
between their GP surgery and mental health team.

Monitoring for side effects of antipsychotic medication
Side effects of antipsychotic medication can be:
• metabolic (including weight gain and diabetes)
• extrapyramidal (including akathisia, dyskinesia and dystonia)
• cardiovascular (including prolonging the QT interval)
• hormonal (including increasing plasma prolactin)
• other (including unpleasant subjective experiences).
The following should be monitored and recorded regularly and systematically throughout
treatment with antipsychotic medication, but especially during titration:
• efficacy, including changes in symptoms and behaviour
• side effects of treatment, taking into account overlap between certain side effects and
clinical features of schizophrenia (for example, the overlap between akathisia and
agitation or anxiety)
• the emergence of movement disorders
• weight, weekly for the first 6 weeks, then at 12 weeks and then every 6 months

Quality statement 7 (developmental):
Home treatment in crisis
Developmental quality statements set out an emergent area of cutting-edge service
delivery or technology currently found in a minority of providers and indicating outstanding
performance. They will need specific, significant changes to be put in place, such as
redesign of services or new equipment.

Quality statement
Children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia who are in
crisis are offered home treatment if it is suitable.

Rationale
Hospital admissions can be disruptive for a child or young person and their family or
carers. It may be possible to avoid hospital admission if treatment and support can be
provided at home. A crisis assessment will determine whether home treatment is a
suitable option, based on the child or young person's needs, risks and circumstances.

Quality measures
The following measures can be used to assess the quality of care or service provision
specified in the statement. They are examples of how the statement can be measured and
can be adapted and used flexibly.

Structure

and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia who are in crisis.
Health and social care practitioners (such as psychologists and social workers) assess

Commissioners (clinical commissioning groups and NHS England) commission home
treatment services for children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or
schizophrenia who are in crisis.
Children and young peoplewith bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia who have a
crisis should have a discussion with their mental health professional to agree if treatment
at home would be better for them than treatment in hospital. Treatment in hospital can be
very disruptive (for example, they may miss time in school).

Crisis
A crisis may be suicidal behaviour or intention, panic attacks or extreme anxiety, psychotic
episodes, or behaviour that seems out of control or irrational and likely to endanger the
person or others. [Department of Health and Social Care's Mental health crisis care
concordat (2014) and expert opinion]

Assessment for suitability for home treatment
A crisis assessment should be carried out by health and social care professionals who are
experienced and competent in crisis working. The decision to start home treatment should
depend not on the diagnosis, but on:

• the severity of the problems
• the vulnerability of the child or young person and issues of safety and support at
home
• the child or young person's ability to adhere to treatment.
[NICE's guideline on service user experience in adult mental health, recommendation 1.5.3,
and NICE's guideline on psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people,
recommendation 1.5.3]

Home treatment
A service that assesses, supports and provides treatment at home to promote
engagement and avoid admission to hospital. The service should be available 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. [NICE's guideline on service user experience in adult mental health,
recommendation 1.5.7 and full guideline]

Equality and diversity considerations
Home treatment should be available to all children and young people with bipolar disorder,
psychosis or schizophrenia in crisis, regardless of their age, if it is assessed as suitable.
Children and young people with psychosis from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are
more frequently subject to compulsory admissions. It is therefore important that health
and social care practitioners take into consideration ethnic and cultural backgrounds when
making assessments for suitability for home treatment, so that compulsory admission is
avoided whenever possible.

Quality statement 8: Education and
employment-related training
Quality statement
Children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis and schizophrenia have
arrangements for accessing education or employment-related training included in their
care plan.

Rationale
Children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia may need
additional support to continue or return to mainstream education or employment-related
training, or to access a suitable alternative education programme within the community or
hospital. Arranging for children and young people to access suitable education or
employment-related training is an important component of transition care planning, and
will improve academic and social development and overall life chances.

audiences
Service providers (such as child and adolescent mental health services, early intervention
in psychosis services and schools) ensure that children and young people with bipolar
disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia have arrangements for accessing education or
employment-related training included in their care plan. This may include support to
participate in mainstream education, employment-related training or referral to an
education programme in an alternative community or hospital setting.
Health and social care practitioners (such as psychologists and social workers) ensure
that arrangements for accessing education or employment-related training are included in
the care plan for children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or
schizophrenia. Practitioners should be aware of local referral pathways and work with local
partners to meet the needs of individual children and young people.
Commissioners (such as clinical commissioning groups, NHS England, local authorities
and regional schools commissioners) commission services that ensure that arrangements
for accessing education or employment-related training are included in the care plan for
children and young people with bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia. They should
also commission alternative education provision in community and hospital settings,
ensuring that appropriate referral pathways are in place and carrying out audits of the
availability, quality and intensity of alternative education provision.
Children and young peoplewith bipolar disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia should have
a care plan that sets out how they can continue their education or training while they are
unwell. If they agree, their healthcare team can contact their school or college to ask their
teachers to give them extra support if needed. If they are too ill to go to school or college,
they may be offered other help with their education (such as education at home or at a
special school) until they get better. They should also be able to continue their education if
they are in hospital.

About this quality standard
NICE quality standards describe high-priority areas for quality improvement in a defined
care or service area. Each standard consists of a prioritised set of specific, concise and
measurable statements. NICE quality standards draw on existing NICE or NICE-accredited
guidance that provides an underpinning, comprehensive set of recommendations, and are
designed to support the measurement of improvement.
Expected levels of achievement for quality measures are not specified. Quality standards
are intended to drive up the quality of care, and so achievement levels of 100% should be
aspired to (or 0% if the quality statement states that something should not be done).
However, this may not always be appropriate in practice. Taking account of safety, shared
decision-making, choice and professional judgement, desired levels of achievement should
be defined locally.
Information about how NICE quality standards are developed is available from the NICE
website.
See our webpage on quality standards advisory committees for details of standing
committee 3 members who advised on this quality standard. Information about the topic
experts invited to join the standing members is available from the webpage for this quality
standard.
NICE has produced a quality standard service improvement template to help providers
make an initial assessment of their service compared with a selection of quality
statements. This tool is updated monthly to include new quality standards.
NICE guidance and quality standards apply in England and Wales. Decisions on how they
apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland are made by the Scottish government and Northern
Ireland Executive. NICE quality standards may include references to organisations or
people responsible for commissioning or providing care that may be relevant only to
England.

impact is considered by the quality standards advisory committee, drawing on resource
impact work for the source guidance. Organisations are encouraged to use the resource
impact products for the source guidance to help estimate local costs.

Diversity, equality and language
Equality issues were considered during development and equality assessments for this
quality standard are available. Any specific issues identified during development of the
quality statements are highlighted in each statement.
Commissioners and providers should aim to achieve the quality standard in their local
context, in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful
discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations. Nothing in this
quality standard should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with
compliance with those duties.
